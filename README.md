#_ Graduation-Admission-Analysis_-
**Abstract** :

The main objective of this project is to visualise and determine the significance of each parameter and predict the admit chances of a candidate based on certain parameters.
**Introduction**:

Currently students are facing difficulties in applying for the right universities that suits their profile with less chances of rejection. As every university have their set of parameters to accept student application, it becomes difficult for a student to understand the probability of acceptance.
**Model **:

Linear Regression model using 5-fold cross-validation is built to interpret the probability of chance of admit into a university by considering other parameters as features to the model.
**Data**:

•	GRE Scores ( out of 340 )
•	TOEFL Scores ( out of 120 )
•	University Rating ( out of 5 )
•	Statement of Purpose and ( out of 5 )
•	Letter of Recommendation Strength 
•	Undergraduate GPA ( out of 10 )
•	Research Experience ( either 0 or 1 )
•	Chance of Admit (ranging from 0 to 1)
